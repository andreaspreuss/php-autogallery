# php-gallery
Simple automatic PHP image gallery with Bootstrap, SASS and Lightbox integration

This is a simple PHP script that scans the content of a directory for files with certain extensions (for example .jpg, .png etc.) and automatically generates a image gallery allocated in Bootstrap responsive, scalable grid. Images can be smoothly previewed thanks to lightbox javascript. CSS stylesheet is generated from SASS .scss file and hence more readable.

**Features:** 

* **PHP loop** that automatically scans for every image in given folder - just put all files in one place, edit CSS / navigation links and it's done! 
* **exif data** (date, comment) integration in picture's caption
* **bootstrap framework** - grid system and navigation fixed menu 
* **lightbox** javascripts for image preview and slideshow
* **SASS** integration for CSS for faster deployment
